# Stacking
A heart attack (Cardiovascular diseases) occurs when the flow of blood to the heart muscle suddenly becomes blocked. From WHO statistics every year 17.9 million dying from heart attack. The medical study says that human life style is the main reason behind this heart problem. Apart from this there are many key factors which warns that the person may/maynot getting chance of heart attack.

This dataset contain some medical information of patients which tells whether that person getting a heart attack chance is less or more. Using the information explore the dataset and classify the target variable using different Machine Learning models and findout which algorithm suitable for this dataset.

In order to increase the accuracy of the model we use ensembling. Here we use stacking technique.
